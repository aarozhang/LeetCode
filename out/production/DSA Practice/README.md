**LeetCode**

Welcome to the solution repository for my leetcode journey! Solutions are arranged by topic and are written in Kotlin.
This repo is intended to be used mainly for reference, but individual solutions can be run by calling the function
from a "main" function. Alternatively, you can
copy and paste the solution code to leetcode and run from the site's ide.
