LeetCode

Welcome to the solution repository for my leetcode journey! Solutions are arranged by topic and are written in Kotlin.
Individual solutions can be run by calling the Solution Class from a "main" function. However, the easiest way to
utilize the code is to
copy and paste over to the leetcode website and run from there.
